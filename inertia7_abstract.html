			Survival Analysis is a field of statistics concerned with analyzing the amount of time until an event occurs. Common applications of survival analysis involve investigating the time until a death of a subject in a medical study or the time until the failure of a mechanical system. In this project we will analyze the failure rates of marriages, with "failure" being a divorce. As you can tell this is a very happy field of research! <br> <br>
			This project is designed to be a soft introduction to applied survival analysis. Something to get you off the ground, so to speak. This project will be especially helpful for any undergraduate Math or Statistics student taking a class on the subject in the near future... perhaps PSTAT 175 at UC Santa Barbara.
